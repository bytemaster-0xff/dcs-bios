// Package serialconnection provides the SerialConnection object, which
// connects to a COM port and provides means to read and write from it
// that are convenient for the other parts of the DCS-BIOS hub use case.
//
// Data is read from the serial port one line at a time and sent to the InputCommands
// channel, which is available as an attribute on the SerialConnection object.
//
// To write data to the serial port, SerialConnection objects implement the
// Writer interface. The implementation ob SerialConnection.Write() never
// returns an error. If the data cannot be sent for any reason, it is silently
// discarded.
